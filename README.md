# Qgetter
Qgetter can get the headimage and nickname of a QQ user, or the head image of a QQ group by a known QQ ID or QQ group ID.
Qgetter is based on the open Tencentâ„¢ QQ headimage and nickname API interface.
Note: If U did not get a satisfactory result, please check does your QQ ID or GROUP ID exists.
